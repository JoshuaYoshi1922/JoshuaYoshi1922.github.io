### About Me

Hi, I'm Joshua Lopez, a software developer who's eager to build and learn. Over the past seven months, I've immersed myself in the LaunchCode program, where I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, React, Java, MySQL, and SpringBoot. I'm now looking for a software developer role where I can bring my problem-solving skills and teamwork to create web applications that are both impactful and a pleasure to use.
